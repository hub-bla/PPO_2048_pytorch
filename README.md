<img src="2048_play.gif" alt="Alt Text" width="300"/>
<p>A custom 2048 environment with PPO agent training. The game is visualized using PyGame and also simplified with a deterministic way of generating new tiles instead of random generation.
The attached image shows how the agent reaches tile 1024.</p>

### Usage
To check how the agent plays use the command below:
```python ./game.py```

To train your own agent you can run:
```python ./main.py```
